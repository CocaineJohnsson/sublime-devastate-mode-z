# DevastateMode-Z

Forked from [DevastateMini](https://github.com/shagabutdinov/sublime-devastate-mini), icons taken from [boXY](https://github.com/oivva/boxy).

Slight tweaks to DevastateMini for a more cohesive UX, colours and overall feel tweaked to be in-line with my colur scheme

### DevastateMini + Mode-Z

Ultra-dark neutral theme, combined with Ultra-dark neutral and balanced editor colour scheme with minimal-distractions in mind.
Every colour was carefully chosen to minimize colour-clash for faster on-the-fly reading.

In addition this theme utilizes Hashed Syntax Highlighting to further aid in quickly scanning identifiers.

### Installation

TODO: Add installation instructions

After installing, you can actiavate the theme either by selecting `UI: Select Theme` and `UI: Select Color Scheme` from the command palette (`ctrl+shift+p` by default) or by adding these lines to your user settings (`Preferences: Settings` in the command palette, or `Menu->Preferences->Settings`)

	  "color_scheme": "color_scheme": "Packages/Mode-Z/Mode-Z.sublime-color-scheme",
